<p> One of the most crucial issues in environmental protection and natural resources conservation is waste 
    management. Various methods can be applied to manage the solid waste. Biological treatment, thermal 
    treatment and landfilling are the common ways for disposal of solid waste. (Seng et al.,
    2011; Yildirim, 2012). Human beings have been making organic fertilizers by biological decomposition
    of organic matter (usually wastes) for an inordinate length of time in an art commonly referred to 
    as composting (Lundin, 2007). The recent increased interest in composting however has arisen 
    because of the need for environmentally sound waste treatment (Yvette, et al.,2000). </p> 
         
<p> The process destroys pathogens, converts nitrogen from the unstable ammonia to stable organic forms, 
    reduces the volume of waste and improves the nature of the waste. It also makes waste easier to handle
    and transport and often allows for higher application rates because of the more stable, slow 
    release nature of the nitrogen in compost (Fauziah and Agamuthu,2009). Composting is a promising
    alternative pretreatment method used to overcome the negative effects on soil environment
    associated with the land application of organic waste because it can provide sanitized. </p>

    <p>According to Fialho et al., (2010), temperature is one of the main parameters for monitoring
         the composting process. The temperature of all compost piles followed the typical temperature 
         pattern of many composting processes: the mesophilic phase (T<50Â°C), where temperature increased
          rapidly; the thermophilic phase, where the temperature reached up to its maximum value, and the 
          cooling and maturation phase, where the temperature stayed constant and close to the ambient 
          temperature. </p>
